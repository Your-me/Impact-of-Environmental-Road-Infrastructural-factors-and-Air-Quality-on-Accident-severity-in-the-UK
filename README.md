# ABSTRACT
The purpose of this study is to consolidate previous research and provide insights to individuals or stakeholders working towards creating a safer and more sustainable transport system i.e. reducing the menace caused by road traffic accidents in the UK.
Adopting data source triangulation methodology, this study analysed the impact of environmental, road infrastructural factors and air quality on accident severity from 2018 – 2023 by following the CRISP-DM methodology, using a similar approach to a study conducted in Taiwan in 2022, this study uses ordinal logistic regression and the other research uses binary logistic regression, Furthermore, this study applied random forest machine learning algorithm to predict accident severity based on factors suggested from the best model during inferential analysis.
Ideal environmental conditions and road infrastructural factors recorded the highest number of accidents and casualties on all levels of accident severity, except for darkness–unlit lighting conditions, which resulted in more accidents. Furthermore, a correlation between sulphur dioxide and accident occurrence was noticed for all the years in this study, ozone correlates with the occurrence of accidents in some specific years too. The machine learning model predicted the occurrence of accident severity with 79.5% accuracy based on the factors from the inferential analysis. 
Using tableau visualisation and ordinal logistic regression model, this study helps shed more insight into the impact of environmental, road infrastructural factors and air quality on accident severity. Further studies are needed to examine the specific impact of sulphur dioxide on road users by triangulating the National Health Service data with the accident and air quality merged data to help develop preventive measures and create appropriate awareness for road users.
